# **Interactive Orbit Visualizer**
Plot an orbit around the Earth. Control your spacecraft. See how your orbit changes!

## **Motivation**
Using Python libraries to create a model of an arbitrary orbit and using user input to change that orbit via impulse burns.

I wanted to showcase some orbital mechanics and software development skills in the same project without the looming goal of a class grade.

I strutured the repository with different files to showcase a style of development I typically walk through - by creating small, sometimes irrelevant, use cases of a unique function (i.e., 3D plotting) to understand how a feature works before incorporating it in a larger setting where the requirements and implementation are more concrete.

## **File Structure**
**testPlot.py:**</br>
**testAnimation.py:**

## **Notable Libraries**
* Numpy (general math operations)
* Matplotlib (plotting)
* Scipy (ODE solver)
